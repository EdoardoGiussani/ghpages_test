MutFinder is an open-source tool designed to search for molecular markers with the potential impact on the biological characteristics of Influenza A viruses of the A(H5N1) subtype, starting from complete or partial nucleotide genome sequences.

A marker is defined as a set of amino acid mutations (one or more mutations located in the same or different proteins) for which a phenotypic effect has been demonstrated.
MutFinder is based on a database containing a list of mutations previously described in the literature as associated with:
- increased zoonotic potential
- increased virulence
- increased/conferred resistance towards antiviral drugs

This database will be periodically updated with new described mutations.

For each marker identified within the submitted sequences, the tool provides information about the position of mutations composing the marker, the effect of the marker described in literature, the influenza subtypes in which the marker was observed or tested, and the corresponding bibliographic references. 
Additionally, the tool produces an Excel workbook for a better visualisation of the obtained data, as outlined in the output section.

The MutFinder functionality will be extended to all influenza A subtypes.
